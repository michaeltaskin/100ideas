The idea of the web really started back in 1891 when two Belgians Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine thought of the Mundaneum, which is basically a collection of thousands of books, letters, newspapers, posters, postcards, etc. These documents were connected by 'links' which were simply index cards with details of the document on them. This idea is the base of what we know as the "web", which is simply a network of millions and millions of documents. Vannevar Bush, a man who worked on the atomic bomb, later described his idea of the Memex in 1945. The Memex was basically a device that could store anything that's ever been recorded. The idea was that we wouldn't need to have the document on hand to be able to retrieve the text, we could simply go to the Memex and get the file. This was the start of what we call hypertext, which is text that links to other text. 

The ideas of the web were there, but the technology to bring it all together and create the internet wasn't. The technology that is key to the web and the internet started during the years of the Space Race. The Soviet Union managed to put a satellite in space before the United States, so naturally the United States was pissed because their pride was hurt. As a result, they vowed that they would never be humiliated like that again and said you know what, we are going to one up the Soviets. To do this, the USA put a man on the moon, but no that was not enough. On top of that, they wanted to create an 'Intergalactic Computer Network'. Paul Baran was the man to do that job and he thought that it would be better to send information by dividing it into blocks, sending those blocks on different paths, and then having them all join up at the destination. A Welsh scientist Donald Davies also had the same idea, so when Paul and Donald found out about eachother's work they collaborated and created what is known as 'packet switching' - dividing packets of information and rejoining them at the end of their path. The next step was the creation of the modem. The modem is essentially a device that allows computers to connect by taking in code and forwarding it as information from one modem to another. The creation of the modem gave the computer a whole new meaning by expanding the possibilites of how it could be used. The idea of the internet finally came together during the 1970's by taking all of the ideas of the web and creating an infrastructure for it all to work in. The internet is the infrastructure and the web is the documents. Even though the infrastructure was in place, the internet was not where it is today. That is because there were many different packet-switching networks created that all had their own rules. To fix this problem, all of the networks agreed to switch to TCP/IP by Janurary 1, 1983. TCP/IP means Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP simply controls transmissions and IP is used to label and transport packets of data, you've probably heard IP used in the term IP Address. By agreeing to use the same rules, all of the networks were able to communicate with one another, and thus the first form of the internet was created. 

We had internet but we wanted to take it to a new level. This is where we get WiFi, which was created by an actress named Hedy Kiestler who came up with the idea of a radio signal that hopped frequencies. The original reason for her coming up with this idea was actually for the military to be able to stop enemies from jamming their communications. Before WiFi there was dial-up connection. Dial-up only allows for one message to be sent at once, however with WiFi, the signal is spread out and allows computers to send messages on different frequencies, thus allowing multiple computers to be connected without interfering with one another. 

This is the internet that we are familiar with today.
