1.) The ISCABBS is an early bbs system that is not mentioned in the book. It was started at the university of Iowa in 1989 and is still running today.(wikipedia) I went to their url and it says that you can access ISCABBS by downloading the source code named D.O.C or you can download a client that will then allow you to access ISCABBS.

2.) GeoCities was saved by two groups: the Archive Team and Archive.org. The GeoCities Project started in order to collect as much data as possible before Yahoo! shut the site down.(https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=GeoCities_Project) 

When it comes to how they are saving the site, Archive Team says, "...about 12-24 people are using GNU Wget against the site to within an inch of its life. Wget is a very resilient utility and is very flexible in capturing data and maintaining it in a good form, and then analyzing it to find more connections."(https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=GeoCities_FAQ) 
So they are basically using a software that collects data on the GeoCities site.
