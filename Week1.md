1.) A flame war is a heated argument where people essentially insult one another, hence the creation of the term "flaming", "flamed", and I would assume "roasted" also has to do something with these.

A flame war has to do with emoticons because the reason that emoticons originated was that jokes on the Carnegie Mellon computer science department's online bulletin board would often be misread and people wouldn't understand that they were jokes. Therefore, a flame war would erupt. To avoid this Scott Fahlman suggested that people put a :-) at the end of a joke or a :-( at the end of something that is not a joke. Emoticons helped stop flame wars from starting.


2.) An emoticon is different from an emoji because it requires you to tilt your head. :-) vs (^_^)

According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, emoticons are "punctuation marks, letters, and numbers used to create pictorial icons that generally display an emotion or sentiment." while emojis are "pictographs of faces, objects, and symbols." 

Basically, if it is typed out then it is an emoticon and if it is a symbol for the face or object then it is an emoji.


3.) "Lossy" compression means that the technique reduces file size by discarding/losing data. Lossly compression is mostly used for images, video, and audio. Lossy compression is good because it makes the file smaller, but bad because it can take away the quality of the media. Examples of lossy compression file types are the JPEG, MP3, and MP4.

Lossless compression is another technique that doesn't lose data. It is good because it keeps the quality, but bad because the file sizes are larger. It can be used for the same things as lossy compression. An example of lossless compression file types are the PNG, PDF, and TIFF.


4.) Metadata is the data that describes data. It helps prioritize the data so that it is easier for us to find things that we search on the web. 

File size is an example of metadata. Say you want to get rid of some files on your computer because you are running out of space on your hard drive. You can sort your files by size to see which ones are taking up the most space and can be deleted. This is possible because the metadata contains this information and is able to sort and order the data based off of the fact that you want to order by file size in specific.

File type is also an example of metadata. You can search for something and then choose the type of file you want. For an image you can choose to only show JPEGs, PNGs, maybe only GIFs. The metadata is able to determine which files fall under the file type you chose and prioritizes those to be the ones that you see.
